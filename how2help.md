Either, you can join [the chat on *gitter*](https://gitter.im/EntrepreneursWithPureIntentions/future?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) and talk to us (__[@DonJohnzen](https://github.com/DonJohnzen)__ & __[@danieltroger](https://github.com/danieltroger)__) or you can [search the whole repo for "`TODO`"](https://github.com/EntrepreneursWithPureIntentions/future/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=TODO) and try to write something smart there instead [of __`TODO`__] !
