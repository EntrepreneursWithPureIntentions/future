Basically:

| Step | Implies                                                                                               |   Progress  |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1    | Write skeleton (basic story, see end of structure.md)                                                | Begun|
| 2    | Structure it into [scenes](https://github.com/EntrepreneursWithPureIntentions/future/blob/master/structure.md)| Begun|
| 3    | Imagine and write the scenes                                                                          | Begun       |
| 4    | Introduce our Idea, reach filmmakers, reach actors, reach people                                      | __TODO__    |
| 5    | See what's to difficult and what's to do better                                                       | __TODO__    |
| 6    | Polish (for example adjust to locations and actors)                                                   | __TODO__    |
| 7    | Grab the cam and go outside shooting                                                                  | __TODO__    |
